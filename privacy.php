                                    <h3>Facebook Tracking</h3>

                                    <p>Facebook Conversion Tracking Pixel With your permission, our website utilizes the
                                        Conversion Tracking Pixel service of Facebook Inc., (“Facebook”). This tool
                                        allows us to follow the actions of users after they are redirected to a
                                        provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. We are thus able to
                                        record the efficacy of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market
                                        research purposes. The collected data remain anonymous. This means that we
                                        cannot see the personal data of any individual user. However, the collected data
                                        are saved and processed by Facebook. We are informing you on this matter
                                        according to our information at this time. Facebook can connect the data with
                                        your Facebook account and use the data for their advertising purposes, per
                                        Facebook’s Data Use Policy found under: <a

                                        Facebook Conversion Tracking also allows Facebook and its partners to show you
                                        advertisements on and outside Facebook. In addition, a cookie will be saved onto
                                        your computer for these purposes. Only users over 13 years of age may give their
                                        permission. If you are younger than this age, please consult your legal
